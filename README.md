# Dead-end detection scripts

This is a set of R scripts that detect dead-ends and indirect streets in OpenStreetMap data imported into PostgreSQL with osm2po. They store data in fields added to the table imported by osm2po. I'm not going to include the script for that, but if you read the code, you'll see the field names and it should be pretty clear what they are and what datatype they need to be.
